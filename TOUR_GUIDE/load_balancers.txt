A load-balancer takes a request and a set of backend servers 
and decides which server will get the request. Nginx ships with 
two load-balancing modules: round-robin, which deals out requests 
like cards at the start of a poker game, and the "IP hash" method, 
which ensures that a particular client will hit the same backend 
server across multiple requests.
