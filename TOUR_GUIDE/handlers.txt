at server startup, each handler gets a chance to attach itself 
to particular locations defined in the configuration; if more than 
one handler attaches to a particular location, only one will "win".

Handlers can return in three ways: all is good, there was an error, 
or it can decline to process the request and defer to the default 
handler (typically something that serves static files).
